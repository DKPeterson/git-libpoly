{"name":"Libpoly","tagline":"C library for manipulating polynomials","body":"LibPoly is a C library for manipulating polynomials. The target applications \r\nare symbolic reasoning engines, such as SMT solvers, that need to reason about\r\npolynomial constraints. It is research software under development, so the \r\nfeatures and the API might change rapidly.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nTo compile on an Ubuntu machine you can install the prerequisites with  \r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install gcc cmake make libgmp-dev python2.7-dev python-sympy\r\n```\r\n\r\nPython is used for testing the library through the Python bindings \r\n(these are also useful for playing with the library). The Python bindings are \r\ncurrently not supported for Macs or Windows machines.\r\n\r\n## Compiling\r\n\r\nTo compile and install perform \r\n```\r\ncd build\r\ncmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=$type -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$prefix\r\nmake\r\nmake install\r\n```\r\nThe $type above is should be either \"Debug\" or \"Release\", and $prefix is the \r\ntarget directory where the library will be installed. The prefix can be \r\nomitted, in which case the library will be installed in the default system \r\nlocation (such as ```/usr/local```).\r\n\r\nIf the tests are enabled, you can do a sanity check of the library by doing a\r\n```make check```.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
