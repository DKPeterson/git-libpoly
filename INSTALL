In the build (cd build) directory perform 

cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=$type

where $type is either Debug or Release.

A simple make will do after that.

In order to use a different compiler set the CC enironment variable prior to 
calling cmake, as in 

CC=`which clang` cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=$type

Once configured, you can not change the compiler.

To run some test, do a make check.
